# FootballMobApp
React Native App made by Edouard de Schietere de Lophem 18072 during the Mobile Applications course at ECAM 2022-2023.

To run the app I strongly recommend using the Expo Go app avaiable on your App Store of choice, so that for running the app you can simply run '''expo go and then you'll be able to run the app and instantly modify it through scanning the given QR code. 

This App is also based on the FootballWebAppAPI so you'll need that one also to run the code and get the data used in the app
